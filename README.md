- First interleaved reasoning approach for clear medical model interpretability.
- CX-Mind surpasses top medical reasoning models in extensive benchmark tests.
- Real-world clinical dataset validates CX-Mind’s utility with expert reviews.



##  Quick Start


### Environment Setup
```bash
# Follow the Easy-R1 official installation procedure
git clone https://github.com/SII-zyj/CX-Mind-private.git
cd CX-Mind
pip install -e .
```
### Data Access & Privacy

This project uses publicly available medical imaging datasets such as **MIMIC-CXR** and **CheXpert**.  
Due to licensing and patient-privacy restrictions, **we do not redistribute any raw images, reports, or derived data**.  
Instead, we willprovide **data preprocessing scripts** that allow users to reproduce our dataset once they have obtained official access credentials.

You must first apply for and download each dataset from the original source:

- **MIMIC-CXR / MIMIC-CXR-JPG** → [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/) (credentialed access required)  
- **CheXpert** → [Stanford ML Group](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) (requires agreement to license terms)


### Start Training
We use Qwen-2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as our foundation model for RL training. 

We recommend using no less than 4 GPUs for close-ended training, and no less than 8 GPUs for open-ended training. 

step 1: need to process the two-stage (closed-ended and open-ended) RL datasets obtained separately.
Prepare data before starting training. We will provide our scripts to process training dataset.

Step 1: Start stage 1 training (closed-ended)
```bash
# First, build a ray cluster for all of the training nodes.
bash ./examples/qwen2_5_vl_7b_closeQA+think+ans_grpo.sh
```

Step 2: Start stage 2 training (open-ended)
```bash
# Second, we need to train the open-ended RL dataset using the pre-trained closed-ended model.
bash ./examples/qwen2_5_vl_7b_openQA+think+ans_grpo.sh
```

### Evaluation
We provide evaluation scripts to evaluate the performance of the trained models.
```bash
# For closed-ended evaluation, run the following command:
./eval/eval_close.py
# For open-ended evaluation, run the following command:
./eval/eval_open.py
```
